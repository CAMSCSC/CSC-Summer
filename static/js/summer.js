The program aims to teach middle school students interested in the fields of Electrical Engineering, Cyber Security, or Computer Science about advanced and fascinating topics that are usually never covered in computer science classes. Topics in this session include: Programming, Forensics, Exploitation (Web & Binary), Cryptography, and Reconnaissance. After comprehensive lessons, we will allow the students to demonstrate their skills in challenges that we have set up. On the last day of the camp, students will compete in a full length Capture the Flag (CTF) hacking competition using the skills they've learned with prizes awarded to top placing teams.",qualifications:"[[u;;]Our Qualifications]\n\nThe CAMS Computer Science Club (CSC) is a relatively new club at the school. However, we have already had many impressive accomplishments by our members. In 2013, our team placed first in the 10th annual national High School Forensics competition at NYU Polytechnic Institute. In 2014, we returned as a national level qualifying team. This year, we ran CAMS CTF, an international computer science and hacking competition that attracted over 2000 students from around the world",date:"[[u;;]Date and Time]\n\nThis summer session will run from 7/7/2015 to 7/10/2015 daily from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M.
