					<h5 class="blue-text">General Information</h5>
					<p>The CAMS Computer Science Enrichment (CCSE) is a summer enrichment program run by the computer science team at the California Academy of Mathematics and Science (CAMS). The program aims to teach middle school students interested in the fields of Electrical Engineering, Cyber Security, or Computer Science about advanced and fascinating topics that are usually never covered in computer science classes. Topics in this session include: Programming, Forensics, Exploitation (Web & Binary), and Cryptography.</p>
					<p>After comprehensive lessons, we will allow the students to demonstrate their skills in challenges that we have set up. On the last day of the camp, students will compete in a full length Capture the Flag (CTF) hacking competition using the skills they've learned with prizes awarded to top placing teams.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="section">
					<h5 class="blue-text">Target Audience</h5>
					<p>CCSE is made for current middle school students and rising freshmen (those entering 9th grade after summer). However, younger or older participants can also join as this program is designed to accommodate students of all skill levels.</p>

					<h5 class="blue-text">Our Qualifications</h5>
					<p>The CAMS Computer Science and Cyber Security Club (CSC) is a relatively new club at the school. However, the team has already had many impressive accomplishments. In 2013, our team placed first in the 10th annual national High School Forensics competition at NYU Polytechnic Institute. In 2014, we returned as a national level qualifying team. This year, we ran <a href="http://camsctf.com" target="_blank">CAMS CTF</a>, an international computer science and hacking competition that attracted over 2000 students from around the world.</p>
					<p>We have also written curriculum using GitBook titled <a target="_blank" href="http://bobbyluig.gitbooks.io/csc-learn/content/">"CSC Learn"</a> that teaches simple to intermediate level computer science topics.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="section">
					<h5 class="blue-text">Date, Time, and Cost</h5>
					<p>The program will run from 07/07/2015 to 07/10/2015 (four days). Every day, the program will run from 9:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. Lunch will be from 11:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. Please note that lunch will be provided on Friday only, the last day of the program. Students should prepare snacks and lunch for the other three days.</p>
					<p>The program cost will be $200 per student for the entire session. At the end, we will provide students with flash drives, t-shirts, and other awards for participating.</p>

					<p>Fear not. We are here to answer your frequently asked questions.</p>
					<ul class="collapsible">
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-content-flag"></i>What is CTF?</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>CTF or Capture the Flag is different in the computer science world. In this area, CTF is a competition in which teams solve challenges and find 'flags.' These flags are not physical flags. Instead, they are strings of characters that can be submitted for points.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-editor-attach-money"></i>Where does the money go?</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>Most of the money goes to covering server costs, infrastructure costs, supervisor compensation, insurance, and most importantly - food. All additional earnings are saved for future club spending. We do not make any money for personal profit.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-hardware-computer"></i>I know nothing about computers!</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>Perfect! We would love to teach you. As long as you have a passion or interest in this area, you will most likely enjoy this summer session a lot. We started out just like you.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-announcement"></i>What is the purpose of this program?</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>As a club, we are really passionate about computer science and cyber security. We feel that classes like Computer Science AP do not focus on the fun and exciting parts of industry. Thus, we founded CSC and made it our goal to teach skills that are vital in industry but often missed in classes. In addition, we want students to get a head start so they can be more prepared to enter the diverse field of science and technology.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-av-not-interested"></i>But hacking is illegal?</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>Some types of hacking are illegal. These types of illicit hackers are called "black-hat" hackers. They use their skills for malicious purpose or personal gain. We are "white-hat" hackers. We hack purely for educational purposes and cyber security. Offense sometimes makes the best defense.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-action-info-outline"></i>That's a lot of stuff to cover.</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>Yup. We have a lot of stuff planned. But we will get through all of it in a fun and understandable manner. We're not college professors lecturing with obscure jargon.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-social-school"></i>What if I'm not a middle school student?</div>
							<div class="collapsible-body">
								<p>Contact us via email and we will be happy to talk about special circumstances.</p>
							</div>
